it while knowing they may have nothing to lose , for example a millionaire who has a a computer company and kows that he makes more money a year than a chain of restaurants owner , and suddenly decides to try and take the risk of opening his own restaurant he has to know that at his own risk he could be looking at failure , but if he has a lot of money he wont have a problem because he could find out what he's doing wrong and try to correct it with advice from professionals , at the risk of not having to face failure , he could also invest it in other kind of business, and guarantee that if hes a successful person at what he does , he might think that he would also be good at what hes trying, people often want to change things they do because as i said before they get bored , they want to try out new things , because they also think that with all the success they have gained , they could really do what ever they wish , but being successful really doesnt mean that you can be successful at anything you do , but i definately agree , because life was made for taking chances and if they want to try something new , the should take the risk maybe they will succeed of maybe they
